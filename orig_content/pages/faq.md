Just a few things to keep in mind during conversation:

1. My aim is to be kind and compassionate, but sometimes I miss social cues. If I do, I sometimes come across as rude.
   This is not my intention. If I ever do this and come off as rude, please let me know and I'll take corrective action.
2. I sometimes answer questions too literally. If I'm not able to answer a question in a way that benefits you, then
   please indicate the purpose of the question so I can better assist you.
