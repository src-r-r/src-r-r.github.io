This Holiday season, add some extra quirky cheer to your party or get-together.

Introducing CUPLES - Cups that belong together.

Each cup contains a beginning of a sentence or an end of the sentence. Have a sentence beginning? Start chatting with someone with an end. Have an end? Start chatting with someone with a beginning! What does your sentence mean? Who knows!

You're chatting with a friend and you happen to notice what your cups say...

- I saw mommy kissin'... ...Mistletoe
- I can't wait to unwrap... ...The other OTHER raindeer
- I heard something on the roof. It must be... ...Wise Men
- I heard something on the roof. It must be... ...The other OTHER raindeer
- Make sure you put up the lights and... ...PA RUM PUM PUM **PUUUUUUUUUMMMMMMM**!

Suddenly you're not just talking about the food or the weather! You're laughing your head off!

Don't just get this one CUPLE. Get all of them!
