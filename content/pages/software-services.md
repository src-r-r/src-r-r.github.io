Business Solutions for Multi-System Architecture
------------------------------------------------

Get a website or service deployed and attract customers to your
business.

I'll improve your capability by getting rid of manual, repetitive,
processes, and ensuring your system is simple to use, is scalable,
and can handle a future with more customers.

I specialize with highly complex systems with lots of moving parts.
Complex business problems that need solving. Systems that need to
work well and need to scale effortlessly.

Expert on Current Trends
------------------------

Over a decade (that's big 'ol 10 years!) in development, I've been
the go-to expert for most of the current technologies:

Database Architecture
---------------------

Whether you're on Microsoft SQL, Google Cloud Services, Amazon Web Services,
or an independently-run PostgreSQL server, I will set up your database to
ensure proper connection to front-end services. I set myself apart by ensuring
database consistency between hosts, meaning you can move from one database to
another without worrying about data loss.

Website Development
-------------------

I've deployed projects and products with the most popular web frameworks
including React, Django, Angular, Vue, Express, and plain ol'
JavaScript/HTML/CSS. With my expertise, I uncover what you're wanting your
website to do, then ensure it follows all the best practices by keeping
documentation up-to-date, ensuring the project is under version control,
and incorporating any additional services needed like Stripe payments or
Mailgun integration. Let me make your vision a reality!
