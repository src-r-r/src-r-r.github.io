More than a Software Developer
==============================

My name's Jordan. I'm a relationship-driven software developer who strives to create
joy, fun, and freedom in peoples' lives.

**I work with small and medium sized businesses to build products,
improve technology, and transform the their business from being average
to being phenominal.**

In addition to being in technology for well over 10 years, I've also
written (and acted in) plays and music. I'm an avid hiker and
photographer, and explore ways that art, philosophy, and humanity
relate to each other in order to serve people better.

I'm on this earth to serve people professionally in many areas besides tech.
In fact, I incorporate technology into many facets of my business and products.

Let me lead your team, your business, or you (personally) into a season of growth and abundance.
