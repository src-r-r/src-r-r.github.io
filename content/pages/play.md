title: Play

# Open Your Imagination and Your World

At what age did you stop playing? And why?

Play is an important part of the human experience, but a part that--all too often--we push aside.
After all, there are more important things than play.

But more often than not, some of the greatest minds in the world practiced playing.

Sometimes these individuals created entire businesses from these times of imagination. Other
times it allowed them to focus on the problem at hand.

## How Does Play Benefit Me?

While not much research has been done on "play" as a practice, research has been
done studying recreation, creativity, and its affects on the brain. Play is different
from these other notions (see below), but they're still important.
